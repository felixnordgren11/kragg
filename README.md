## General info

This was a project to convert a AC-DC converter to a lab bench power supply unit. It utilizes a Raspberry Pi with a display which runs the GUI. It sends the users input to the 485 via CAN protocol. 

## Hardware and Technologies
The hardware needed for this project is:

* A Raspberry Pi 4/3 (or Zero if it could work)
* A 16 GB SD card
* A SPI-CAN extension, like this [one](https://www.electrokit.com/produkt/can-bus-modul-mcp2515-tja1050-spi/).
* [This LCD](https://www.electrokit.com/produkt/3-5-tft-display-for-raspberry-pi-med-touch/).
* One rotary encoder.
* Four buttons.
* Six 10kÎ© resistors.
* The box which can be printed from the included STL-files.

The needed software:
* Python 3.10 and the dependencies listed in 'requirements.txt'
* A copy of Raspbian available from the [Raspberry Pi imager](https://www.raspberrypi.com/software/)

* If the setup file does not install Pillow, write the following line in the terminal to install it manually:
```
python3 -m pip install --upgrade
```


## Setup

Begin by downloading the Raspberry Pi imager from the software page on their website. Then, insert the SD card into your computer and choose the 32-bit OS and write it to the SD. 

Now, insert the SD-card into the Raspberry PI and hook it up to a monitor in order to configure it. Choose a password and use *pi* as username. 

After it has been set up correctly, open the terminal and write:
```shell
git clone https://github.com/felixnordgren11/kragg
```
This will clone the repository into /home/pi.
Then you will have to type in the following commands:

```shell
cd kragg

chmod +x lcd.sh

./lcd.sh
```
Respond with a 'y' and then press enter when prompted, this will run the last file and reboot the system.
#
When the system has booted up again, open the terminal and type (in order):
```shell
cd kragg

chmod +x setup.sh

./setup.sh
```
to enter the kragg folder, make the setup.sh file executable and then run it. When told, enter 1 and press 'Enter' to run the last file and reboot the system.



## Build and GPIO connections


### GPIO connections (pin numbers found here: https://pinout.xyz/#):
* 1-26 is occupied by the touch screen.

#### Connections for buttons and rotary encoder

* Pin 27 (GPIO 0):  Rotary left
* Pin 28 (GPIO 1):  Rotary right
* Pin 29 (GPIO 5):  Button Left
* Pin 30 (Ground):  Empty
* Pin 31 (GPIO 6):  Button Right
* Pin 32 (GPIO 12): Voltage Button
* Pin 33 (GPIO 13): Current Button
* Pin 34 (Ground):  Empty

#### Connections for CAN bus

* Pin 35 (GPIO 19): MISO
* Pin 36 (GPIO 16): CS
* Pin 37 (GPIO 26): INT
* Pin 38 (GPIO 20): MOSI
* Pin 39 (Ground):  GND
* Pin 40 (GPIO 21): SCK

The VCC pin on the CAN bus has to be connected to a 5 V power source pin, but the screen occupies both of the Raspberry Pi's 5 V pins. Instead, a cable needs to be cut, branched and soldered/crimped so that the CAN bus can get power from the same source as the computer.
